# Business Concept

## Problem
Analysts manually identify daily market movers, read multiple sources, and summarize why prices moved.
This is slow, inconsistent, and hard to scale for daily executive updates.

## Stakeholders
- Executives: want a fast, clear daily summary.
- Analysts: need evidence-backed insights and a repeatable workflow.
- Operations: need a reliable, automated run that produces consistent outputs.

## Solution Summary
Daily Movers Assistant automates the end-to-end flow:
1. Pulls the top market movers.
2. Enriches each ticker with news and context.
3. Applies an agentic reasoning layer to produce explainable recommendations.
4. Renders outputs in HTML, Excel, and email.

## Value
- Faster daily insight delivery.
- Explainable outputs with traceable evidence.
- Consistent artifacts for review and audit.
